      <p>
        The Service Provider does not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children. The Service Provider encourages all children to never submit any personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services. The Service Provider encourages parents and legal guardians to monitor their children's Internet usage and to help enforce this Policy by instructing their children never to provide personally identifiable information through the Application and/or Services without their permission. If you have reason to believe that a child has provided personally identifiable information to the Service Provider through the Application and/or Services, please contact the Service Provider (<a href="mailto:richard@zwolschezeeverkenners.nl">richard@zwolschezeeverkenners.nl</a>) so that they will be able to take the necessary actions.

      </p>

      <h2>How is your information kept secure?</h2>
      <p>
        The Service Provider is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. The Service Provider provides physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order to operate, develop, or improve their Application. Please be aware that, although we endeavor to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches.
      </p>

      <h2>How will you be informed of changes to this Privacy Policy?</h2>
      <p>
        This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
